        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Karthik, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. I completed my schooling at Vidyo and furthered my education with a Pre-University course at PPC. Now in my second year of engineering, I am passionate about technology, coding, and exploring innovative solutions to real-world problems.

I have a strong foundation in programming languages, data structures, and algorithms, and I'm constantly looking to enhance my skills through hands-on projects and learning. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, and I aim to make a meaningful impact in the tech world.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy collaborating on projects, participating in hackathons, and keeping up with the latest trends in technology.</p>

                <h3>Project</h3>
                <p>During my first year, I had the opportunity to work on an internship with a talented group of individuals. We built a website focused on cooking and recipes, which aimed to help people explore new dishes and improve their cooking skills. This project not only gave me hands-on experience in web development but also taught me the importance of user-friendly design and collaboration</p>
